        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before 1900</strong> - Picasso's training under his father began before 1890</li>
          <li><strong>Blue Period: 1901–1904</strong> - characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colours</li>
          <li><strong>Rose Period: 1904–1906</strong> - is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours, and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques</li>
          <li><strong>African art and primitivism: 1907–1909</strong> - begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Picasso painted this composition in a style inspired by Iberian sculpture, but repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytic cubism: 1909–1912</strong> - is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes</li>
          <li><strong></strong> cubism: 1912–1919 - was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art</li>
          <li><strong>Neoclassicism and surrealism: 1919–1929</strong> - In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style</li>
          <li><strong> The Great Depression to MoMA exhibition: 1930–1939</strong>  - the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's Guernica. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings.</li>
          <li><strong>World War II and late 1940s: 1939–1949</strong>  - During the Second World War, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city. Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica. "Did you do that?" the German asked Picasso. "No," he replied, "You did"</li>
          <li><strong>Later works to final years: 1949–1973</strong> - Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas. He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix.</li>
